probably the biggest film I've ever done, and probably the biggest film that has come out of India in a long, long time. And to have a world premiere of this class and standard in London, I don't know what could be better. Oh, fantastic. But, you know, the end of it all is that it's a Mani Ratnam film, and I was part of a Mani Ratnam film. From there on, everything is secondary. The fact that Mr. Mani Ratnam cast me in one of his central characters in a huge film like this is a huge confidence boost for an actor like me. And, yes, it was a privilege to have shared screen and set space with actors of this caliber. and for an actor like me, I don't know if I could have learned so much during the course of a single film as I have during Ravan. I'm not at liberty to tell you a lot, but yeah, the film revolves around three people, three characters, and I play one of them. Oh, that's a whole USB that you're not familiar with this incredible story. So I'm sorry I can't tell you a lot about the story, but what I can assure you is that if you go onto a theater and buy a ticket and discover it for yourself, you won't be disappointed. Not just Bollywood, I think that's what all actors would aspire to do because to get your work across the barriers of language and regionalism is what an actor should aspire for. Nothing better for a performer to have his performance, to have his work watched and accepted worldwide. So yes, that is what every actor, regardless of Bollywood or wherever in the world, would aspire to, and that's what I aspire to do as an actor as well. Yeah, well, I come from a part of India where musicals are not as big as they are in north of India. I come from the south of India in a place called Kerala. But yes, I am a professional singer as well. So I do my fair share of singing. Well, I've seen a lot of people streaming, but I've not seen a lot of people streaming in London before. So that's a new.
